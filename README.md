This repository contains functionality related to data science and machine learning.

The most interesting funcitonality is:

I have been looking at the ability to predict Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates.

The first model is a classifier that looks at freight transportation data that is released
by the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and predicts if GDP is increasing or decreasing.

I first created a Logistic Regression model and didn't get the performance I wanted so I then
also built a neural network classifier.  It is producing results in the range that I was hoping for.

This can be viewed here: https://github.com/schkotty/Data-Science/blob/master/GDP-Predictor/GDP-Predictor.ipynb

I am also looking at predicting the GDP growth rate based on DOT transportation data.
