This repository contains functionality related to data science and machine learning.

The most interesting funcitonality here are the models that I have built to look at the 
ability to predict Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates.

The first model I built is a classifier that looks at freight transportation data that is released
by the US Department of Transportation (DOT) and predicts if GDP is increasing or decreasing.

I then created a neural network regression model to predict the GDP growth rate based on that
same DOT data.  The python notebooks and reports for these are available at:
